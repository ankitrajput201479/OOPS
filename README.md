# OOPS
Object oriented programming in C++
This repository contains my C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) practice and concepts, written in a simple and beginner-friendly way.
It covers all the core OOPS principles with examples and programs.

I created this repository as part of my journey to strengthen C++ fundamentals before moving to DSA and core CS subjects.
